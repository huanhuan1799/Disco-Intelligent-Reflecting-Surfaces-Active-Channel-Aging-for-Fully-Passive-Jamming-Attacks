# Disco-Intelligent-Reflecting-Surfaces-Active-Channel-Aging-for-Fully-Passive-Jamming-Attacks
We highly respect reproducible research, so we try to provide the simulation codes for our published papers. There are some codes for our TWC paper "Disco Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces: Active Channel Aging for Fully-Passive Jamming Attacks." Please run the file named Main_TWCDISCO_Fig4.

For more details about the DISCO idea, please refer to our recent paper as follows:
